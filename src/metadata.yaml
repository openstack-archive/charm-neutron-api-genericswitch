  Neutron is a virtual network service for OpenStack, and a part of
  Netstack. Just like OpenStack Nova provides an API to dynamically
  request and configure virtual servers, Neutron provides an API to
  dynamically request and configure virtual networks. These networks
  connect "interfaces" from other OpenStack services (e.g., virtual NICs
  from Nova VMs). The Neutron API supports extensions to provide
  advanced network capabilities (e.g., QoS, ACLs, network monitoring,
  etc.)
  .
  This charm configures the neutron-api service with the OpenDayLight
  SDN solution.
