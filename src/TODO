Todo:
* Figure out how to do new world v oldworld rendering
* Just about everything.
* I: No icon.svg file.
* W: no copyright file
* W: no README file
* I: missing recommended hook start
* Confd ssh keys installed from /cisco/etc/confd/ssh
* Interfaces allocated to VPP should be configured within the /cisco/etc/qn.conf file via a Cisco provided script

Done-ish
* QEMU 2.2 and libvirt 1.2.8 or greater.

Done
* 1GB of hugepages allocated upon system boot. Adjusting vm.nr_hugepages within the /etc/sysctl.conf. 
* vm.max_map_count should be adjusted in line with hugepages (The default of 65536 equals 1GB of hugepages)
* For debugging purposes, apport needs to be uninstalled and corekeeper installed in its place on compute hosts.
